Hi !
I'm Simon, I'm a Swift iOS developer. I started swift about 6 years ago when I was in my 3rd year of Epitech and it's been my favorite language since then. 
I have worked LVMH at 24S where I discovered how international online retail works with great people and at Netatmo which was a great experience in the IOT world.
My first personal project and the one I've always come back to since then has been a Pokedex, which you can always find a version of on my GitHub (the actual one is pretty new, but pretty cool codewise I think).
I've had the incredible luck to work in highly senior environments for all of my career, which allowed me to progress very quickly and gain a deep understanding of Swift both on a technical and conceptual standpoint.
I am now searching for a new challenge with new people that I could learn from, and for that challenge to be even more appealing I want it to be outside of my comfort zone, abroad to allow me to discover and immerse myself in a new culture.
